Summary: 4 VMs recommended for single master install.  Additional VM if NFS services are needed.
* Infrastructure (physical or virtual machines, assuming virtual):
* Master (1 VM Required)
   * 16GB RAM
   * 4 vCPUs
   * 20GB Disk (for OS)
   * 30GB Disk (for Docker, raw/unformatted)
   * RHEL7.4 upgraded to latest patchset
* Container Hosts (2-3 VMs recommended) 
   * 16GB RAM
   * 4 vCPUs
   * 20GB Disk (for OS)
   * 30GB Disk (for Docker, raw/unformatted)
   * RHEL7.4 upgraded to latest patchset
   * 50GB Disk if using CNS(for gluster, raw/unformatted)
* Additional VM if NFS is needed
   * 8GB RAM
   * 2 vCPUs
   * 100GB Disk (Minimum)
   * RHEL7.4 upgraded to latest patchset
* Internet connectivity is required (via proxy is fine)
   * HTTPS Whitelist these trusted hosts in proxy (if needed)
For content (RPM packages):
- subscription.rhn.redhat.com
- cdn.redhat.com
For docker registry:
- registry.access.redhat.com
   * Choose a domain name for Openshift – Example: apps.example.com
   * Using the above example, the applications will get a name as: appname-projectname.apps.example.com
   * Create a wildcard entry in parent DNS zone that points to master VM
   * Ex:  A record *.apps in zone example.com
This DNS record is absolutely required and is often the most time consuming task to get done (internal approvals are likely required)


Activate the Openshift subscriptions provided by Red Hat. If using a Satellite Server, synchronize the relevant channels to the Satellite Server.
   * rhel-7-server-rpms
   * rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
   * rhel-7-server-ose-3.6-rpms
   * rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms
   * rh-gluster-3-for-rhel-7-server-rpms (if deploying CNS/Gluster)
