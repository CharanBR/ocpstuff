#### # This is a howto on deploying a more complete prometheus stack onto Openshift Container Platform 3.9. 
##### # Some components of prometheus (alerting) are in the pending 3.9 release, however, fall far short of expectations.  This document is to be used as a stop gap until RH can officially production-ize Prometheus and GA it as a part of Openshift.
