Summary: 4 VMs recommended for single master install.  Additional VM if NFS services are needed.
* Infrastructure (physical or virtual machines, assuming virtual):
* Master (1 VM Required)
  * 16GB RAM
  * 4 vCPUs
  * 20GB Disk (for OS)
  * 30GB Disk (for Docker, raw/unformatted)
  * RHEL7.4 upgraded to latest patchset
* Container Hosts (3 VMs recommended) 
  * 16GB RAM
  * 4 vCPUs
  * 20GB Disk (for OS)
  * 30GB Disk (for Docker, raw/unformatted)
  * RHEL7.4 upgraded to latest patchset
  * 50GB Disk (for CNS, raw/unformatted)
* Additional VM if NFS is needed
  * 8GB RAM
  * 2 vCPUs
  * 100GB Disk (Minimum)
  * RHEL7.4 upgraded to latest patchset
* Internet connectivity is recommended (via proxy is fine)
  * HTTPS Whitelist these trusted hosts in proxy (if needed)
	For content (RPM packages):
	- subscription.rhn.redhat.com
	- cdn.redhat.com
	For docker registry:
	- registry.access.redhat.com

* DNS Requirements 
  * Choose a domain name for Openshift – Example: ocp.example.com
* Create a wildcard entry in parent DNS zone that points to master VM
* Ex:  A record '*.ocp' IN zone example.com
**This DNS record is absolutely required and is often the most time consuming task to get done (internal approvals are likely required)**

Activate the Openshift subscriptions provided by Red Hat. If using a Satellite Server, synchronize the relevant channels to the Satellite Server.
   * rhel-7-server-rpms
   * rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
   * rhel-7-server-ose-3.7-rpms
   * rhel-7-fast-datapath-rpms
   * rh-gluster-3-for-rhel-7-server-rpms

Additional Considerations:
   1. RHEL7.4 (Vanilla ISO is recommended)
    - The “Minimum” installation is recommended
   2. SELinux must be in “Enforcing” (this is the default in vanilla image)
   3. NetworkManager must be enabled (this is the default in vanilla image)
   4. iptables must be enabled (this is the default in vanilla image)
